# HackHERS2020 - Hack Heroes

## Inspiration
This year's theme of superheroes is what inspired us and a winner from last year's hackathon. The driving force behind the project was finding something that was a fun app that anyone could find humor in. Our project is similar to the recent instagram craze that has been going on, but we put our own fun spin on it!

## Short Describing
There is a camera that takes a photo of the user. Then it analyzes the photo and returns an emotion rating, superhero related to that emotion rating and a photo of the user as that superhero.

## Challenges we ran into
Our first challenge was downloading the applications necessary to turn on the camera to take the photo. Next was finalizing our idea because there were many paths that we wanted to go down, but only few that could be accomplished within the given time. Other challenges were solved with basic debugging.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of!
