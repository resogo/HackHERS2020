# HackHERS2020 - HackHEROs

## Inspiration
This year's theme of superheroes is what inspired us, along with a winner from last year's hackathon, to create a fun and humorous superhero project. Our project is similar to the recent Instagram craze that has been going on, but we put our own fun spin on it!

## Short Describing
Have you ever wondered what superhero you might look like? Well with this project that can come true. Our project analyzes facial structure and using cutting-edge facial recognition software, returns an emotion rating, a photo of that super hero and a photo of the user as that superhero.

## How We Built It & Challenges We Ran Into - FIX
Our first challenge was downloading the applications necessary to turn on the camera to take the photo. Next was finalizing our idea because there were many paths that we wanted to go down, but only few that could be accomplished within the given time. Other challenges were solved with basic debugging.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of!
As a group that had a hackathon newbie and were not well-versed in python we are very proud of our project. There were many aspects that could have been cause for quitting, but through patience, communication and teamwork we solved each of those problems and completed our project.

## What We Learned - FIX?
We learned how to use Python and opencv to control the camera to take photos for our project. We also learned more about Google API, specifically Google Vision API, and how to implement it within our project. We also got more practice using github and debugging our overall program. This hackathon also provided us with the opportunity to work on our soft skills and overall communication.

## What's Next For HackHEROs? - FIX?
For now we do not have a definitive plan of approach. We may begin by experimenting with the different avenues that we did not have the opportunity to touch upon during the hackathon. One such avenue was working on the accuracy of the facial emotion detection. More times than not the readings were "Very Unlikely" in cases where the chosen superhero had a definitive facial expression. Another avenue was expanding on the programmed emotions and teaching the API to detect more complex/mixed emotions. Other such avenues would help us to expand on the overall accessibility of the program and how to market it for modern-day consumers.
